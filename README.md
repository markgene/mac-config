# Config Mac

This is my personal notes and logs for configurating my Mac computers.

My computers are configurated in a very similar way, but not exactly the 
same, because: 

1. The package and/or environment management systems keep evolving. I used to 
manage the tools with MacPorts and then changed to Homebrew. Now, I use Homebrew 
to install conda and then manage the conda environments for different purposes 
and/or projects.
1. The tools keep evolving. I used Perl for analyzing biological sequences 
many years ago. I shifted to Python and R since they make my life easier for 
new techniques in bioinformatics and genomics. For instance, for single-cell 
data, R and Python-based tools are much easier to use and available.
