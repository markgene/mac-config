Here is the document about my macOS config. If you are interested in config your macOS in the same or similar way as I do, you may be interested in my background work. In brief, I am a scientist in the field of bioinformatics. I mostly program in R and Python. I also work on web development sometime.

# macOS versions

I have used or am using the following macOS versions:

* Sierra version 10.12.6

# Homebrew: package manager

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is my major package manager. I have used to [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) before. You can use it as an alternative.

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

# Git: version control system

I use `git` for version control. 

```bash
brew install git
brew install caskroom/cask/sourcetree
```
